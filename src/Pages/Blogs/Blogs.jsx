                                JWT, or JSON Web Token, is a public standard used to share a security system between two teams â€” a customer and a server. Each JWT contains decoded JSON objects, such as a set of claims. JWTs are linked using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims can not be altered after the token is issued.
